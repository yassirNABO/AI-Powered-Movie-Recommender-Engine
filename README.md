# AI-Powered-Movie-Recommender-Engine
A high-performance Movie Recommendation Engine using Content-Based Filtering and Cosine Similarity. Analyzes metadata (genres, descriptions) for 5,000+ titles.
# 🎬 AI-Powered Movie Recommender Engine

## 🧠 Core Concept
This project implements a **Content-Based Filtering** engine that suggests movies based on their metadata and plot descriptions. It uses advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand the context of each title.

## 🛠 Advanced Technical Implementation
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transformed unstructured text data into a high-dimensional vector space, filtering out non-informative English stop words.
- **Cosine Similarity Matrix:** Built a computational model to measure the "angular distance" between 5,000+ movie vectors to identify the closest matches.
- **Matrix Scaling:** Efficiently handled a large similarity matrix, demonstrating the ability to work with **Memory-Intensive Data Structures**.

## 📊 Why this matters for Big Data?
Recommendation engines are the backbone of modern data-driven companies (TikTok, YouTube, Amazon). This project showcases the ability to turn **Textual Information** into **Predictive Insights**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integration of **Collaborative Filtering** (User-item interaction).
- Deployment via **Streamlit** for a real-time UI.
